# Goal
"This problem demonstrates the use of the chain of responsibility (COR) design patterns on a Length converter program (LCP) with a GUI. The LCP performs conversion from kilometer to one of the following three units: Mile, Yard, and Foot and should have a User Interface."

# Implementation Information
"The input string specifies the amount to be converted and dropdown menu indicates which unit it will convert to. The CoR pattern will be applied to the processing of the input string to generate a number representing the converted amount. The LCP user interface is seen as a client making a request to convert the input to a given unit. Three handlers are available, one for each unit (MILE, YARD, FOOT)."
